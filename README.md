# Pioneer-Workingdir
The working dir when I, Zhehao Lu, participated in the research program with Pioneer on LIGO and gravitational waves during 2016. The research was directed by a professor from West Point University--Dr. Myers.
The entire project consists of 4 papers, the latter two are heavy with analysis and include some python scripts that are used for data analysis.
The final paper is posted (or published?) on LIGO's official site: https://losc.ligo.org/projects/
